# Microsoft Learn - Power BI (PL‑300)

This repository documents my progress through the Microsoft Learn content for the **PL‑300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst** certification. It also serves as a place to organize supporting scripts, technical notes, labs, and references that are useful in day‑to‑day data work.

Note: No confidential information is stored here. Any datasets referenced or included are public or provided by Microsoft for training purposes.
